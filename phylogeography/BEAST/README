This directory contains xml files (of the tested best model) used to infer phylogeography transitions under the  discrete trait model (mugration model), implemented in BEAST v1.10.4. 

Transitions between states are estimated under the asymmetric model of Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection -BSSVS. 

Two sets of xmls are created and run:
1/ Three technical replicates from 222 ST34 genomes as outlined in the divergence time analysis (Figure 2 in the paper; America: 18; East Asia: 32; Europe: 39; Oceania: 18; Southeast Asia: 115)
2/ Three technical replicates from 256 ST34 genomes with the inclusion of blaCTX-M-55 positive genomes in a more balanced sampling scheme (America: 39; East Asia: 50; Europe: 56; Oceania: 42; Southeast Asia: 69)
